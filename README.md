# Perceptron
A Perceptron is a fundamental unit of a neural network that models a single-layer binary classifier. It takes weighted inputs, applies an activation function (often a step function), and produces an output. The perceptron learns by adjusting weights based on errors, using an iterative learning algorithm.
